Min Max Difference
In this problem you will be given an array/list of integers. You need to find the largest value and the smallest value in the array. Finally you need to return the difference (largest value - smallest value) of the two values.Example:
the_array = [15, 22, 84, 14, 88, 23]the_highest_value = 88the_smallest_number = 14the_difference = 74

Order List
Find Max
Find Min
return max-min

list = []

for i in list:
    ol = i.order
